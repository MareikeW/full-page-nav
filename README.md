# full-page-nav

Weekly coding challenge by CodePen: "Build a full-page navigation experience."

Description:
"Full-Page Navigation
Sometimes site navigation warrants more room than a row of links. Mega menus were popular for a while, particularly on big complicated sites, and proved to be pretty effective. What's the most mega of all menus? A navigation menu that makes use of the entire screen!"
